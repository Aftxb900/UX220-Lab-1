## Hi, my name is Aftab Patel. 
The favorite thing I wrote is a poetry for my girlfriend on her birthday, as she is living in Saudi Arabia.
So I wrote a piece to make her day special and memorable. Sending her the poem made me happy, knowing it would bring a smile to her face and show her how much I care.
